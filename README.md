Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This year my goal is to complete all tasks and collect all 50 Stars (last year I only managed to get 47) without additional help.  
I'm using Java cause that's where I'm most comfortable and quickest.  
I'll also take a slightly different approach and use the examples to write short unit tests.
